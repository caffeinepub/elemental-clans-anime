Add an 'Add Another Character' button that appends a new blank entry to the array. Add a remove button next to each entry (disabled when only one remains). Update the form submission handler to call the backend addCharacters method with the array of character entries. Preserve all existing single-character edit/update functionality. Ensure the character list refreshes after successful bulk submission and display clear success/error messages to the admin."
