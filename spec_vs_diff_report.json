  "summary": "The diff implements all six requirements with high fidelity. Backend unlockBadge/getUnlockedBadges functions are added, all 13 badges are defined in badges.ts, badge unlock logic is present in useBadgeUnlockLogic.ts and QuizResultPage.tsx, ProfilePage.tsx shows a badges section with BadgeCard, toast notifications appear via BadgeUnlockToast, and useQueries.ts adds both hooks. Minor gaps include: clan loyalty majority-of-answers logic is not implemented, and quiz trait scores are derived from saved profile data rather than actual quiz answers.",
