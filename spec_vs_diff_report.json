  "summary": "The diff implements bulk character creation for both backend and frontend. The backend adds an `addCharacters` method in main.mo, the frontend adds a `useAddCharacters` hook in useQueries.ts, and CharactersPanel.tsx is updated with a multi-entry modal form. Most acceptance criteria appear to be met, but some details cannot be fully verified due to file truncation.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Individual character creation still works via the existing addCharacter method.",
      "reason": "The backend main.mo file is truncated, so it is not possible to confirm that the existing `addCharacter` method is preserved alongside the new `addCharacters` method.",

      "description": "A migration module (backend/migration.mo) was added that defines old and new actor type structures and a migration run function.",
      "reason": "The build request only asked for a bulk character creation API and UI update. No migration module was requested in any requirement.",
